# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 104: Oct 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 4h Today was another Jekyll and Hyde day. I spent 2h on doing Ruby koans and 2h doing 4 js codewars questions (2, 6 and 2, 7 kyu). I definitely need to stop switching languages, and I also need to make sure that I'm getting in a good mix of learning and actual coding. I feel like I've 'learned' a lot of concepts that I can look back on my notes and not really remember much of. I need to try to blend the learning with the coding so that it sticks better.

That being said I am going to try to focus on JS for the next month and then reevaluate afterwards. I could go on to react, or do some postgres, I'm not sure. I AM sure that I'm not learning much and getting all mixed up by switching between ruby and js so often.

I also read an interesting article on 'Deep Focus', and I want to pay attention to my focus levels while learning. That seems like a goal (getting good focus) that will reap big dividends.

###Below I didn't want to flip the formatting. Newest first makes more sense, but I'm not about to reformat 40 posts. Moving on they wil be the right way.

### Day 0: July 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I did 3 hours of cs101. I'm on lesson 5/30. 22% done. It's covering python and its mostly beginner topics right now, but it's still good to get the fundamentals covered. Today we learned about find() in strings, string indexing, and functions. I learned that you can do boolean operators comparing alpha characters! a<b = True.

I also set up a github account and did the beginner github tutorial.

### Day 1: July 4, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Back at it again with cs101. I finished unit 2 which covered procedures and the if statement. assertions were covered for the first time and we did a function that calculated days between two dates. I am up to 37% complete, and some of the questions slowed me down a bit. I put in 4 hours today.

### Day 2: July 5, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I wasn't stoked on another night of learning to code, so I decided to actually write something tonight. It called the noDaysOff calendar and I posted about it here. I spent about 3 hours on it and I was really happy with my modest success. I'll keep chipping away at it over time.

### Day 3: July 6, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I put in 4 hours today on cs101. I'm up to unit 4 and 56% of the way through the course. not bad for four days! today I learned a lot of cool stuff. I learned the intricacies of list concatenation, how to use list.index and "value in list" as a boolean test. I also learned about depth-first and width-first algos in scraping.

### Day 4: July 7, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: hours on cs101. hash functions, data structures, and a lot about transferring data across the world. I learned about ord() and chr(). Using modulo to evenly divide entries into buckets was a pretty cool thing to learn. I also saw a bit of code that was appending chars to the last string in a list. I think it is neat.
output[-1]=output[-1]+char

### Day 5: July 8, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 3h on cs101. lots and lots of dictionary talk. This is also my first full week of studying AND blogging, so things are shaping up. I plan on going to a python meetup this week and finishing cs101. I'm unsure if I should go on to the next cs class or do a more specialized python class like django.

### Day 6: July 9, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2h on cs101. I feel terrible, but I pushed through. we learned about recursive functions, and my mind was blown. We also learned about a web result relaxation ranking  algorythm that seems pretty confusing. the recursion is hard to see for a beginner. I need to rewatch that a few times.

### Day 7: July 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2h Today I started on my idea to make a scraper program that downloads new images from my email. It conditionally works now. I spent about 2h on it.I also went to the Boston python users meetup! Tonight was project night, so it was mostly people talking with each other. It was a lot of fun. I sat at the beginner table and we had a lot of talk about intro python stuff, some of which I knew, and some of which was new to me. Maybe the most interesting thing I learned was about the spyder ide. I don't like having to tab back and forth between sublime and terminal, so being able to do it all in one program really appeals to me.

### Day 8: July 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 1.75h Between feeling sick and having a super sick kid I didn't get in as much studying as I wanted today. I did 45min of rewriting my notes from the udemy python bootcamp class, and an hour of work on noDaysOff. I fixed the day-of-week bug and added a total hours worked counter. Rewriting my notes is super valuable, but also really draining. I think it may be because it isn't actually learning anything new (just reinforcing), and also because I am a terrible typer and I end up doing a lot of deleting. Typing-wise I'm getting much better at my alphas, slightly better at my numbers, and I don't want to talk about the punctuation. I also listened to an episode of "podcast.__init__" while I was out for a walk. I feel like I'm just starting to have enough vocabulary to get something out of podcasts like that.  I also struggle with podcasts because they tend to be fairly low information density, but without supporting visuals it's hard to listen to them at a high speed and slow down when something interesting comes up. It's a good way to build familiarity with the lingo, but I dont think I could entirely learn through podcasts.

### Day 9: July 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 7.5h  I was able to put a ton of work in today. I did 5 hours of coding and 1.5 hours of rewriting my notes. I pushed code for noDaysOff and did an initial commit for kaymbu_image_downloader. It was great to be able to put in a bunch of time.

### Day 10: July 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 1.5h  This weekend was rough. I definitely need to plan for trips so that I know what to study and how to do it if I have poor internet. I ended up listening to an  episode of talk python to me ("10 books python developers should be reading" ) and listening to Ned Batchelder's pycon talk about how to treat unicode in your programs. His main strategy is to have unicode on the outside and utf8 on the inside. He was running the python meetup I went to this week, and it's clear he knows his stuff.

### Day 11: July 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2.25h  Tonight I listened to two "talk python to me" episodes, ("pythonic career advice" and "4 python web frameworks compared") and also watched about 30 minutes of tutorials on pytest. I'm going to push myself to write tests for everything I make moving forward. It seems like a way to actually save debug time, especially when it's a complicated thing like a web app.

### Day 12: July 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2h tonight I did 2 sections of Tim Buchalka's python masterclass on Udemy, focused on OOP. This is a concept that still seems hard for me to understand. In the example of a flask webserver I don't know why it makes sense to go OOP vs functional programming because you are not usually going to have more than one instance.  At least I understand a bit more about OOP, even if I'm not done learning. I also got my web app running on my laptop. Previously it was set up to run on the pi, but that felt very cumbersome to develop on. Even if the end use is going to be on the pi it makes sense to get it running on my laptop so I can iterate faster. On the plus side I realized that the flask app is already OOP. I had been banging away at it without fully realizing that when I started it months ago!

### Day 13: July 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 7h Tonight I did a ton of work on my email image scraper and started learning some data structures. I also did:
2h Data Structures & Algorithms in Python - Udemy
15m Algorithms and Data Structures Knowledge to Get a Python Job? - Youtube 

### Day 14: July 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 4h I worked on sorting algorithms from  Data Structures & Algorithms in Python - Udemy This is my first taste of sorting algorithms, and now I can see why some people are afraid of them. This stuff really requires you to slow down and think it through. You have to remember not only how to write the algo, but also how efficient it is (in both processing and space), AND what type of scenarios are ideal for each algorithm.  My one criticism of this class is that is that it is obvious that this is not a python-specific class, even though it has python in the name. It seems like they recorded videos that are language agnostic and then interspersed them with python quizzes. The tough thing about that approach is that it is all theoretical lessons, and then they basically say "Now write a bubble sort algorithm!" I'm sure that some people can follow that, but it feels a bit slow/unproductive to grind away, writing (or trying) to write an algo that most other classes would show you an example of. I wrote one of the three intro ones and then found example code of the rest. I heavily commented the example code as a way of learning and understanding how they work.

### Day 15: July 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 6.5h I did about 3h more of Data Structures & Algorithms in Python - Udemy and it continues to be a slog. I'm not sure if it is always this difficult or if maybe I should have more fundamentals under my belt. Either way it is really forcing me to slow down and focus. Recursive sorting algorithms are a 1-2 punch of things I am just barely starting to understand. On the other hand I wrote a fun script that will allow me to copy a file or folder of files with a user-entered delay. This is great for when you want to move big things but not swamp your network. having tiny little scripts like that is a great distraction.

### Day 16: July 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2h More work on Data Structures & Algorithms in Python - Udemy. Not too much else to add. I'm still unsure if I'm getting the most out of this class, but I doubt it will be the last algo class I take. I also did one kata on codewars.

### Day 17: July 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2h I started cleaning up the quizzes for cs101, making sure I actually did them all. It is nice because it shows me how much I have learned, but it is definitely slower than I would like. The videos fly by, but you certainly don't prove that you have learned anything just by watching a video! It takes actually writing the code to do that.

### Day 18: July 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 4h I'm almost done with the remaining quizzes on cs101. I am looking at cs253 next, and then branching off into something else.

### Day 19: July 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 1.5h Tonight I tackled OOP again. I'm relatively comfortable with the 'how', but I am lost with the 'why'. More specifically I am unsure about why I should write code as object-oriented when my planned end use only involves one object. That seems like it would be more code vs functional programming. I did 6 videos in Corey Schafer's OOP series. This still didn't give me much info on the 'why', but it definitely gave me a lot more info and tricks on the 'how'. This series was also good in that it talked about naming conventions as well. I feel like this is hard to learn from a book, and easy to get wrong when writing code in a vacuum. I also did a few interview question videos, but the quality of those videos is really mixed. I think they get a lot of traffic so everyone in the programming video space is making them. All of the ones I saw last night weren't worth mentioning.

### Day 20: July 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2.5h mostly cs101 on udacity, but a little codewars as well. I'm only 2 questions away from finishing (for real this time!) I'm not sure if I am going to go on to cs253 next. I probably should. Recursion is starting to stick a little bit better, and my supplemental oop videos seem to be working as well. I should think up and build something oop for a test project. I also watched a few general interest python videos today. Corey schafer has one on 10 things you should know to prepare for a python job interview. It was a decent video, but I fear he seems to be making it out to be a bit easier than it will actually be. Hopefully not, but it seems pretty easy when he says it. I'm also interested in starting to do some git pull requests for small things, so this video was interesting. Contributing to Open-Source Projects as a New Python Developer: How to Do It His argument was that it's better to establish actual connections with people than to do random pull requests. I think his reasoning was that beginners will often do things incorrectly, and it ends up putting a load on the maintainers. Consequently the maintainers have little patience for beginners and both sides feel like they are wasting their time.

### Day 21: July 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 3.5h I started cs253 on udacity. There are a few "interesting" things about this class. It's not in the official course listing and you can't find it by searching. After taking the first 2 sections I think I understand why. They basically teach a small amount of html and then say "now install google app engine!" with a few links on how to do that. The course was released initially in 2012, and google app engine has changed a LOT since then. None of the commands in the links work for me (on a mac) and I've been struggling trying to find the newer replacement commands. The one thing that does work is using their entirely online code editor, but that's really slow and I hope that isn't the only way. They mention that you can technically use any hosting provider, but that they won't be able to help you with anything outside of google. I've been considering using pythonanywhere.com, but it seems like there is a fair amount of GAE-specific code and instruction. I also think that things will get a lot more complicated when databases start to be involved. I could imagine them pulling the course (possibly temporarily) based solely on the amount of hand-holding that must be required to install GAE.

### Day 22: July 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 3.5h 1.5 of cs253 and 2h reconfiguring my Google App Engine install and working on the first assignment - "rot13 encoding a textarea".  This felt really good once I was able to get it working locally and then deploy it to the cloud. For future reference:

 dev_appserver.py . (to run locally)
 gcloud app deploy (to deploy)
 gcloud projects create unique-project-name (make new proj.)
 
### Day 23: July 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 4.5h of cs253. Jinja templates were lesson 2.5 and it was great to get a refresher on that. I had picked up a little jinja info previously but it was very scattered. It's nice to have a broader base to build off of.  I'm on lesson 3 now - databases! I've been interested and afraid of learning databases for quite some time now. I think that may be because (for some reason in my head I thought) mysql code has always looked like unintelligible garbage to me. Regardless of the reason it is well past time that I start using databases, as my previous (ab)use of too many text files as a database is fairly ridiculous. I'm also seeng the benefit gap between applications and web apps shrinking. I've always preferred desktop applications due to their ease of use, but the underlying python code is very similar and the benefit of not having to 'ship' anything seems really, really attractive. I think it will be a while away before I have any code that multiple people are using, but when I do I can see a lot of benefits to them accessing it via the web.

### Day 24: July 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2.5h of cs253. DATABASES!! I've been looking forward to this. It hasn't been bad so far. I also haven't written much from the ground up yet either. I wish I was learning more SQL and not GQL, but it seems like it is similar, if not a subset of all SQL commands.  I still only understand the bobby tables comic in a general sense. I bet I'll understand it more specifically in a day or two.



### Day 25: July 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2.25 of cs253. I made my first blog today! I also started on hashing. The blog assignment had me worried because it felt like a big assignment. Ultimately it wasn't that hard to do once I broke it down into small enough pieces. I think that's a takeaway for a lot of programming. If you break it down into small enough pieces you can always build the next function. The trick is to understand it well enough before you start building, or else you will end up with a half built, unfunctional program.

### Day 26: July 29, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 3h of cs253.  We covered hashing and password security, setting and getting cookies, and started on a new user feature for our blog. I don't know why it took me so long to figure this out, but I realized that I need to be saving my code quizzes and commenting them. I'm not good enough at rote memorization in order to remember the code snippets so I'm constantly going back and forth between the quizzes and the test. That brings up another weird thing about this class (and all udacity classes so far.) I really dislike how they name the structures of the class. Most lessons have two lesson numbers in their name. (see below) I think it is because the initial lesson order has been changed. Either way it is common enough that they really need to figure something else out. I'm tired of looking for lesson one / lesson three, and not having any clue as to which one I am actually on.

### Day 27: July 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 1.5h of cs253, 2h of boston python meetup. Tonight I went to the Boston python meetup. It's the second time I have been to a meeting and this is the first time it has been a presentation. The last one I went to was a project night where people group together by interest and learn and teach and network. Last night Wolfgang Richter from soroco talked about using encrypted bytecode as a way to distribute python applications without distributing the sourcecode. Also Eugene Kovalev spoke at length about itertools and how they can make your life easier and your code more efficient. It's funny how the more you know, the more you can get out of these events. Just two nights ago I heard about macd for the first time in a cs253 lesson, and then Wolf used it on one of his slides tonight! As a beginner it's always nice to see a little light at the end of the tunnel, even if it is miles away!

### Day 28: July 31, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 1.5h of assorted youtube videos. I wasn't feeling up to pushing more on the cs253 user login project, so I learned a bit more about unittesting in python, using pylint, I watched a class on sql injection attacks from Tim Buchalka, and I watched a video from Dan Bader on how to write clean, yet readable code.

This has been a hell of a month. I've learned a ton, and worked a ton. I'll post a month recap soon!

### Day 47: August 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 5h in! I'm back on python today, working on trying to get some old code polished up with new features. I need to get things live, then make better things, then take older things offline. If I wait for the current thing to be awesome I am going to wait a while, as I'm constantly learning and the older work always feels 'bad' in comparison. I also did an hour or two (included in the 5) of gordon Zhu's class. 

### Day 48: August 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I got a ton in tonight and this morning. 8 hours! I started and finished ud803 - Intro to Javascript on udacity. https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803 I also did 30 min of Gordon Zhu's reading Javascript class.

### Day 49: August 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 2.5 hours. Today was a really mixed up day programming-wise. I did 60 min of gordon's class, 1 hours of reviewing old concepts and playing around making sample code, and half an hour of doing the 30 Day Vanilla Javascript Challenge. It felt pretty good to actually code some things. Today I did 3 of the challenges: drum machine, analog clock, and modifying css variables with js. They were all fun, and pretty simple. I started commenting in each one that showed what I learned, and I'm also trying to overcomment all of them as self-documentation. I revisited the localStorage section of Gordon's class and made examples in there. I also started on the testing section. I need to start writing tests. now. In python and in js. OH! I also went to the Boston Python meetup. Tonight was a lightning talk night, and 7 people gave 5-15 minute speeches. It was pretty cool, and gave me a lot of feedback on how I can make my presentation suck less. I talked to The organizer - Ned about it as well, so I'm going to get it polished up and he will find a week for it some time.

**TODO**:
Add some features to the drum machine so that it can become a keyboard tester. put it online somewhere.
Figure out my notes situation. Get them in one spot that is searchable and synced across machines.
Look into sublime text's multi line editing. It has only screwed me so far, but I can see it can be useful if you are actually trying to use it.

### Day 50: August 22, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:
2 hours. I did one of the challenges (#4 - array cardio) from #Javascript30 that was mostly just watching him code and me taking notes. I still learned a bunch, but it felt less rewarding since there was very little struggle in it. I also reformatted most of my js notes into one evernote file. I've been meaning to get all of my notes in one place online so that I can access it via any computer. I'm trying out evernote for now. time will tell.

### Day 51: August 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:
8.23 2.5h I did some of Gordon's class, a tiny bit of #javascript30 and then broke out for my own project. Time has flown by since I started actually coding though! I wrote a few tests this morning and that was actually kind of fun. Hopefully I can start doing it a bit more in the future

### Day 52: August 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:
2h. 30m of Gordon's lesson on rebuilding filter() with tests, an hour working on an auto cut detection thing in python, and another half hour of trying to get opencv installed and looking at sublime workflow stuff. It's getting hard to stay focused on both Gordon's lessons and the Javascript30 because it feels like too much repetition (testing in Gordon's class) or spoon feeding (javascript30) I still need to learn a ton, but I'm not sure if I'm learning efficiently from either tonight.

### Day 53: August 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:
1.5h one hour of Gordon's class on building tests for the filter() and map() functions. That is getting really repetitive. At least I'm baking in what the functions do! I also did 30m of #Javascript30 Map reduce is next. fingers crossed!

### Day 54: August 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:
8.26 2h of Gordon's class. I'm over the testing section (and there is still almost three hours on his reduce tests alone!) so I skipped ahead to some code reading. I'm not sure if this would be easier / more rewarding if it was part of an 8 hour+ training day, but as it is I definitely find myself questioning if my time could be better spent learning things other than testing (after the first two or three hours) I just wrapped up the section reading underscore and it was good. Strangely though he didn't actually read any underscore. All that he read was on the search function on the underscore docs. He kept talking about reading through a ~1700 lines of code, and main.js only has ~70.
### Day 55: August 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:
8.27 3.15 I started on freecodecamp's site today to get up to speed on css and some html. It's a nice change of pace from writing test functions. I also put in some good work on my timer app.
### Day 56: August 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:
8.28 2h I finished up the freecodecamp css section and the accesibility section. I learned a lot about how to use tags and colors to make things easier for people who interface with the web in slightly different ways. I listened to a clip of a screen reader and it was mind numbingly fast! I also did a few css animation things that were pretty interesting. I'm unsure when they will really come in handy though.

**Update - I'm still going! I just hate updating on my blog - twitter AND github**
